    <h1>Bee Movie By Jerry Seinfeld</h1>
    <pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
NARRATOR:
(Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
According to all known laws
of aviation,
 :
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
 :
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
 :
The bee, of course, flies anyway
 :
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
BARRY BENSON:
(Barry is picking out a shirt)
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
 :
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
JANET BENSON:
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
BARRY:
Coming!
 :
Hang on a second.
(Barry uses his antenna like a phone)
 :
Hello?
ADAM FLAYMAN:

(Through phone)
- Barry?
BARRY:
- Adam?
ADAM:
- Can you believe this is happening?
BARRY:
- I can't. I'll pick you up.
(Barry flies down the stairs)
 :
MARTIN BENSON:
Looking sharp.
JANET:
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.
BARRY:
Sorry. I'm excited.
MARTIN:
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
 :
A perfect report card, all B's.
JANET:
Very proud.
(Rubs Barry's hair)
BARRY=
Ma! I got a thing going here.
JANET:
- You got lint on your fuzz.
BARRY:
- Ow! That's me!

JANET:
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!
(Barry flies out the door)
JANET:
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!
(Barry drives through the hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a
newspaper)
BARRY==
- Hey, Adam.
ADAM:
- Hey, Barry.
(Adam gets in Barry's car)
 :
- Is that fuzz gel?
BARRY:
- A little. Special day, graduation.
ADAM:
Never thought I'd make it.
(Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving)
BARRY:
Three days grade school,
three days high school...
ADAM:
Those were awkward.
BARRY:
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
ADAM==
You did come back different.
(Barry and Adam pass by Artie, who is jogging)
ARTIE:
- Hi, Barry!

BARRY:
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
ADAM:
- Hear about Frankie?
BARRY:
- Yeah.
ADAM==
- You going to the funeral?
BARRY:
- No, I'm not going to his funeral.
 :
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.
 :
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
ADAM:
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.
(The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the
highway)
 :
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our regular day.
BARRY:
I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
(Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly over the graduating
students)
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.
(Barry and Adam sit down and put on their hats)
 :
- Well, Adam, today we are men.

ADAM:
- We are!
BARRY=
- Bee-men.
=ADAM=
- Amen!
BARRY AND ADAM:
Hallelujah!
(Barry and Adam both have a happy spasm)
ANNOUNCER:
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
 :
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
DEAN BUZZWELL:
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...
 :
...9:
 :
That concludes our ceremonies.
 :
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!
ADAM:
Will we pick our job today?
(Adam and Barry get into a tour bus)
BARRY=
I heard it's just orientation.
(Tour buses rise out of the ground and the students are automatically
loaded into the buses)
TOUR GUIDE:
Heads up! Here we go.

ANNOUNCER:
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.
BARRY:
- Wonder what it'll be like?
ADAM:
- A little scary.
TOUR GUIDE==
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco
 :
and a part of the Hexagon Group.
Barry:
This is it!
BARRY AND ADAM:
Wow.
BARRY:
Wow.
(The bus drives down a road an on either side are the Bee's massive
complicated Honey-making machines)
TOUR GUIDE:
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life
 :
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.
 :
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
 :
Our top-secret formula
 :
is automatically color-corrected,

scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
 :
into this soothing sweet syrup
 :
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...
EVERYONE ON BUS:
Honey!
(The guide has been collecting honey into a bottle and she throws it into
the crowd on the bus and it is caught by a girl in the back)
ADAM:
- That girl was hot.
BARRY:
- She's my cousin!
ADAM==
- She is?
BARRY:
- Yes, we're all cousins.
ADAM:
- Right. You're right.
TOUR GUIDE:
- At Honex, we constantly strive
 :
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.
 :
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.
(The bus passes by a Bee wearing a helmet who is being smashed into the
ground with fly-swatters, newspapers and boots. He lifts a thumbs up but
you can hear him groan)
 :
ADAM==

- What do you think he makes?
BARRY:
- Not enough.
TOUR GUIDE:
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.
(They pass by a turning wheel with Bees standing on pegs, who are each
wearing a finger-shaped hat)
Barry:
- Wow, What does that do?
TOUR GUIDE:
- Catches that little strand of honey
 :
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
ADAM:
(Intrigued)
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
TOUR GUIDE:
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones.
But bees know that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.
 :
But choose carefully
 :
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.
(Everyone claps except for Barry)
BARRY:
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.
ADAM:

What's the difference?
TOUR GUIDE:
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off
 :
in 27 million years.
BARRY:
(Upset)
So you'll just work us to death?
 :
We'll sure try.
(Everyone on the bus laughs except Barry. Barry and Adam are walking back
home together)
ADAM:
Wow! That blew my mind!
BARRY:
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?
 :
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
ADAM:
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.
BARRY:
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?
ADAM:
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.
 :
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

BARRY:
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?
ADAM:
Like what? Give me one example.
(Barry and Adam stop walking and it is revealed to the audience that
hundreds of cars are speeding by and narrowly missing them in perfect
unison)
BARRY:
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.
ANNOUNCER:
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.
BARRY:
Wait a second. Check it out.
(The Pollen jocks fly in, circle around and landing in line)
 :
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
ADAM:
- Wow.
 :
I've never seen them this close.
BARRY:
They know what it's like
outside the hive.
ADAM:
Yeah, but some don't come back.
GIRL BEES:
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!
(The Pollen Jocks hook up their backpacks to machines that pump the nectar
to trucks, which drive away)

LOU LO DUVA:
You guys did great!
 :
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks!
I love it!
(Punching the Pollen Jocks in joy)
I love it!
ADAM:
- I wonder where they were.
BARRY:
- I don't know.
 :
Their day's not planned.
 :
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.
 :
You can't just decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.
ADAM==
Right.
(Barry and Adam are covered in some pollen that floated off of the Pollen
Jocks)
BARRY:
Look at that. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.
ADAM:
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
BARRY:
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.
(Barry waves at 2 girls standing a little away from them)

ADAM==
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
BARRY:
Distant. Distant.
POLLEN JOCK #1:
Look at these two.
POLLEN JOCK #2:
- Couple of Hive Harrys.
POLLEN JOCK #1:
- Let's have fun with them.
GIRL BEE #1:
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.
BARRY:
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!
 :
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!
(Slaps Adam with his hand to represent his scenario)
GIRL BEE #2:
- Oh, my!
BARRY:
- I never thought I'd knock him out.
GIRL BEE #1:
(Looking at Adam)
What were you doing during this?
ADAM:
Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities.
BARRY:
I can autograph that.

(The pollen jocks walk up to Barry and Adam, they pretend that Barry and
Adam really are pollen jocks.)
POLLEN JOCK #1:
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?
BARRY:
Yeah. Gusty.
POLLEN JOCK #1:
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.
BARRY:
- Six miles, huh?
ADAM:
- Barry!
POLLEN JOCK #2:
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.
BARRY:
- Maybe I am.
ADAM:
- You are not!
POLLEN JOCK #1:
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
 :
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
BARRY:
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.
(The scene cuts to Barry looking out on the hive-city from his balcony at
night)
MARTIN:

Hey, Honex!
BARRY:
Dad, you surprised me.
MARTIN:
You decide what you're interested in?
BARRY:
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.
 :
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?
MARTIN:
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
 :
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.
 :
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
BARRY:
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,
 :
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.
MARTIN:
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?
 :
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.
 :

Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!
JANET:
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
BARRY:
- I'm not trying to be funny.
MARTIN:
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
JANET:
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
BARRY:
- No one's listening to me!
MARTIN:
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
BARRY:
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
(Barry's parents don't listen to him and continue to ramble on)
MARTIN:
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
BARRY:
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.
 :
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold to…
appy apartments)
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,
 :
every last drop.
(Men in suits are pushing all the honey of the aisle and into carts)
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more
(We see a statue of a bear-shaped honey container being pulled down by
bees)
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.
 :
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.
(We see Winnie the Pooh sharing his honey with Piglet in the cross-hairs of
a high-tech sniper rifle)
BARRY:
(Looking through binoculars)

Wait for my signal.
 :
Take him out.
(Winnie gets hit by a tranquilizer dart and dramatically falls off the log
he was standing on, his tongue hanging out. Piglet looks at Pooh in fear
and the Sniper takes the honey.)
SNIPER:
He'll have nausea
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.
(Flash forward in time)
BARRY:
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...
(Mr. Sting is sitting at home until he is taken out of his house by the men
in suits)
STING:
But it's just a prance-about stage name!
BARRY:
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products
 :
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.
(An old lady is mixing honey into her tea but suddenly men in suits smash
her face down on the table and take the honey)
OLD LADY:
Can't breathe.
(A honey truck pulls up to Barry's hive)
WORKER:
Bring it in, boys!
 :
Hold it right there! Good.
 :
Tap it.

(Tons of honey is being pumped into the hive's storage)
BEE WORKER 1#:
(Honey overflows from the cup)
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!
 :
- I think we need to shut down!
=BEE WORKER #2=
- Shut down? We've never shut down.
 :
Shut down honey production!
DEAN BUZZWELL:
Stop making honey!
(The bees all leave their stations. Two bees run into a room and they put
the keys into a machine)
Turn your key, sir!
(Two worker bees dramatically turn their keys, which opens the button which
they press, shutting down the honey-making machines. This is the first time
this has ever happened)
BEE:
...What do we do now?
(Flash forward in time and a Bee is about to jump into a pool full of
honey)
Cannonball!
(The bee gets stuck in the honey and we get a short montage of Bees leaving
work)
(We see the Pollen Jocks flying but one of them gets a call on his antenna)
LOU LU DUVA:
(Through "phone")
We're shutting honey production!
 :
Mission abort.
POLLEN JOCK #1:
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.
(The Pollen Jocks fly back to the hive)

(We get a time lapse of Central Park slowly wilting away as the bees all
relax)
BARRY:
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.
ADAM:
Oh, yeah?
BARRY:
What's going on? Where is everybody?
(The entire street is deserted)
 :
- Are they out celebrating?
ADAM:
- They're home.
 :
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.
 :
I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.
BARRY:
At least we got our honey back.
ADAM:
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
 :
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.
 :
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.
 :

And now...
 :
Now I can't.
(Flash forward in time and Barry is talking to Vanessa)
BARRY:
I don't understand
why they're not happy.
 :
I thought their lives would be better!
 :
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.
VANESSA:
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?
BARRY:
- What did you want to show me?
(Vanessa takes Barry to the rooftop where they first had coffee and points
to her store)
VANESSA:
- This.
(Points at her flowers. They are all grey and wilting)
BARRY:
What happened here?
VANESSA:
That is not the half of it.
(Small flash forward in time and Vanessa and Barry are on the roof of her
store and she points to Central Park)
(We see that Central Park is no longer green and colorful, rather it is
grey, brown, and dead-like. It is very depressing to look at)
BARRY:
Oh, no. Oh, my.
 :

They're all wilting.
VANESSA:
Doesn't look very good, does it?
BARRY:
No.
VANESSA:
And whose fault do you think that is?
BARRY:
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
VANESSA==
(Staring at Barry)
Bees?
BARRY:
Specifically, me.
 :
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.
VANESSA:
It's not just flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
BARRY:
That's our whole SAT test right there.
VANESSA:
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.
 :
And then, of course...
BARRY:
The human species?
 :
So if there's no more pollination,

 :
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?
VANESSA:
I know this is also partly my fault.
BARRY:
How about a suicide pact?
VANESSA:
How do we do it?
BARRY:
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
VANESSA:
- That just kills you twice.
BARRY:
Right, right.
VANESSA:
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.
(Vanessa leaves)
BARRY:
(To himself)
I had to open my mouth and talk.
 :
Vanessa?
 :
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?
(Vanessa is getting into a taxi)
VANESSA:
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.
 :

They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.
 :
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.
BARRY:
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.
VANESSA:
I know. Me neither.
(The taxi starts to drive away)
BARRY:
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.
 :
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?
 :
Roses!
 :
Vanessa!
(Barry flies after the Taxi)
VANESSA:
Roses?!
 :
Barry?
(Barry is flying outside the window of the taxi)
BARRY:
- Roses are flowers!
VANESSA:
- Yes, they are.
BARRY:
Flowers, bees, pollen!

<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

VANESSA:
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.
BARRY:
Maybe not.
Could you ask him to slow down?
VANESSA:
Could you slow down?
(The taxi driver screeches to a stop and Barry keeps flying forward)
 :
Barry!
(Barry flies back to the window)
BARRY:
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.
VANESSA:
Yes, it kind of is.
BARRY:
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you
 :
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.
VANESSA:
Actually, it's completely closed down.
BARRY:
I thought maybe you were remodeling.
 :
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.
VANESSA:
I don't want to hear it!

BARRY:
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.
 :
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.
 :
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.
 :
- Bees.
VANESSA:
- Park.
BARRY:
- Pollen!
VANESSA:
- Flowers.
BARRY:
- Re-pollination!
VANESSA:
- Across the nation!
 :
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, California.
 :
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.
 :
Security will be tight.
BARRY:
I have an idea.

(Flash forward in time. Vanessa is about to board a plane which has all the
Roses on board.
VANESSA:
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.
(Holds out badge)
 :
Official floral business. It's real.
SECURITY GUARD:
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
=VANESSA==
Thank you. It was a gift.
(Barry is revealed to be hiding inside the brooch)
(Flash back in time and Barry and Vanessa are discussing their plan)
BARRY:
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.
VANESSA:
How about The Princess and the Pea?
 :
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!
BARRY:
Yes, I got it.
 :
- Where should I sit?
GUARD:
- What are you?
BARRY:
- I believe I'm the pea.
GUARD:
- The pea?
VANESSA:

It goes under the mattresses.
GUARD:
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.
VANESSA:
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!
 :
Let's see what this baby'll do.
(Vanessa drives the float through traffic)
GUARD:
Hey, what are you doing?!
BARRY==
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...
 :
...without arousing suspicion.
 :
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.
(Flash forward in time and Barry and Vanessa are about to get on a plane)
SECURITY GUARD:
Stop! Security.
 :
- You and your insect pack your float?
VANESSA:
- Yes.
SECURITY GUARD:
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?
VANESSA:
- Yes.

SECURITY GUARD:
Would you remove your shoes?
(To Barry)
- Remove your stinger.
BARRY:
- It's part of me.
SECURITY GUARD:
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.
(Barry plotting with Vanessa)
BARRY:
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.
(Flash forward in time and Barry and Vanessa are flying on the plane)
Can you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!
VANESSA:
I think this is gonna work.
BARRY:
It's got to work.
CAPTAIN SCOTT:
(On intercom)
Attention, passengers,
this is Captain Scott.
 :
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.
 :
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.
VANESSA:
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.
BARRY:

I gotta get up there
and talk to them.
VANESSA==
Be careful.
(Barry flies right outside the cockpit door)
BARRY:
Can I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
(The flight attendant opens the door and walks out and Barry flies into the
cockpit unseen)
BARRY:
Captain, I'm in a real situation.
CAPTAIN SCOTT:
- What'd you say, Hal?
CO-PILOT HAL:
- Nothing.
(Scott notices Barry and freaks out)
CAPTAIN SCOTT:
Bee!
BARRY:
No,no,no, Don't freak out! My entire species...
(Captain Scott gets out of his seat and tries to suck Barry into a handheld
vacuum)
HAL:
(To Scott)
What are you doing?
(Barry lands on Hals hair but Scott sees him. He tries to suck up Barry but
instead he sucks up Hals toupee)
CAPTAIN SCOTT:
Uh-oh.
BARRY:
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!

HAL:
(Hal doesn't know Barry is on his head)
- Who's an attorney?
CAPTAIN SCOTT:
Don't move.
(Scott hits Hal in the face with the vacuum in an attempt to hit Barry. Hal
is knocked out and he falls on the life raft button which launches an
infalatable boat into Scott, who gets knocked out and falls to the floor.
They are both uncounscious.)
BARRY:
(To himself)
Oh, Barry.
BARRY:
(On intercom, with a Southern accent)
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.
 :
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?
(Vanessa looks confused)
(Normal accent)
...And please hurry!
(Vanessa opens the door and sees the life raft and the uncounscious pilots)
VANESSA:
What happened here?
BARRY:
I tried to talk to them, but
then there was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.
 :
Now one's bald, one's in a boat,
and they're both unconscious!
VANESSA:
...Is that another bee joke?
BARRY:

- No!
 :
No one's flying the plane!
BUD DITCHWATER:
(Through radio on plane)
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?
VANESSA:
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.
BUD:
Where's the pilot?
VANESSA:
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.
BUD:
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?
BARRY:
As a matter of fact, there is.
BUD:
- Who's that?
BARRY:
- Barry Benson.
BUD:
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.
BARRY:
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.
 :
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

VANESSA:
I can't fly a plane.
BARRY:
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
VANESSA:
- Yes.
BARRY:
How hard could it be?
(Vanessa sits down and flies for a little bit but we see lightning clouds
outside the window)
VANESSA:
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.
(An ominous lightning storm looms in front of the plane)
(We are now watching the Bee News)
BOB BUMBLE:
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,
 :
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.
 :
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...
ADAM:
That's Barry!
BOB BUMBLE:
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers
 :
and an incapacitated flight crew.
JANET, MARTIN, UNCLE CAR AND ADAM:
Flowers?!
(The scene switches to the human news)

REPORTER:
(Talking with Bob Bumble)
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls
 :
with absolutely no flight experience.
BOB BUMBLE:
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.
BUD:
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.
 :
They've done enough damage.
REPORTER:
But isn't he your only hope?
BUD:
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.
 :
Their wings are too small...
BARRY:
(Through radio)
Haven't we heard this a million times?
 :
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."...
BOB BUMBLE:
- Get this on the air!
BEE:
- Got it.

BEE NEWS CREW:
- Stand by.
BEE NEWS CREW:
- We're going live!
BARRY:
(Through radio on TV)
...The way we work may be a mystery to you.
 :
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.
 :
But let me tell you about a small job.
 :
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.
 :
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.
 :
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.
 :
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.
 :
We get behind a fellow.
 :
- Black and yellow!
BEES:
- Hello!
(The scene switches and Barry is teaching Vanessa how to fly)
BARRY:

Left, right, down, hover.
VANESSA:
- Hover?
BARRY:
- Forget hover.
VANESSA:
This isn't so hard.
(Pretending to honk the horn)
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
(A Lightning bolt hits the plane and autopilot turns off)
Barry, what happened?!
BARRY:
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.
VANESSA:
- That may have been helping me.
BARRY:
- And now we're not!
VANESSA:
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
(The plane plummets but we see Lou Lu Duva and the Pollen Jocks, along with
multiple other bees flying towards the plane)
Lou Lu DUva:
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!
 :
Move out!
(The scene switches back to Vanessa and Barry in the plane)
BARRY:
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!
(Barry sticks out his arms like an airplane and flys in front of Vanessa's
face)

VANESSA:
Don't have to yell.
BARRY:
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.
VANESSA:
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!
BARRY:
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
VANESSA:
I can't do this!
(Barry slaps Vanessa)
BARRY:
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!
VANESSA:
(Slaps Barry)
You snap out of it.
BARRY:
(Slaps Vanessa)
 :
You snap out of it.
VANESSA:
- You snap out of it!
BARRY:
- You snap out of it!
(We see that all the Pollen Jocks are flying under the plane)
VANESSA:
- You snap out of it!
BARRY:
- You snap out of it!

VANESSA:
- You snap out of it!
BARRY:
- You snap out of it!
VANESSA:
- Hold it!
BARRY:
- Why? Come on, it's my turn.
VANESSA:
How is the plane flying?
(The plane is now safely flying)
VANESSA:
I don't know.
(Barry's antennae rings like a phone. Barry picks up)
BARRY:
Hello?
LOU LU DUVA:
(Through "phone")
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?
(All of the Pollen Jocks are carrying the plane)
BARRY:
The Pollen Jocks!
 :
They do get behind a fellow.
LOU LU DUVA:
- Black and yellow.
POLLEN JOCKS:
- Hello.
LOU LU DUVA:
All right, let's drop this tin can

on the blacktop.
BARRY:
Where? I can't see anything. Can you?
VANESSA:
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.
 :
Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.
BARRY:
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.
(On the runway there are millions of bees laying on their backs)
BEES:
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
BARRY:
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.
VANESSA:
- What?
BARRY:
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.
 :
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.
 :
Bring the nose down.
BEES:
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR:
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
BUD:
- Get some lights on that!

(It is revealed that all the bees are organized into a giant pulsating
flower formation)
BEES:
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
BARRY:
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
VANESSA:
- OK.
BARRY:
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?
LOU LU DUVA:
Affirmative!
BARRY:
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.
 :
Land on that flower!
 :
Ready? Full reverse!
 :
Spin it around!
(The plane's nose is pointed at a flower painted on a nearby plane)
- Not that flower! The other one!
VANESSA:
- Which one?
BARRY:
- That flower.
(The plane is now pointed at a fat guy in a flowered shirt. He freaks out
and tries to take a picture of the plane)
VANESSA:
- I'm aiming at the flower!

BARRY:
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower
made of millions of bees!
(The plane hovers over the bee-flower)
 :
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.
 :
Rotate around it.
VANESSA:
- This is insane, Barry!
BARRY:
- This's the only way I know how to fly.
BUD:
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?
(The plane is unrealistically hovering and spinning over the bee-flower)
BARRY:
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!
 :
Just drop it. Be a part of it.
 :
Aim for the center!
 :
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!
 :
Come on, already.
(The bees scatter and the plane safely lands)
VANESSA:
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

BARRY:
- Yes!
(Vanessa is about to high-five Barry)
No high-five!
VANESSA:
- Right.
ADAM:
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?
BARRY:
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!
ADAM:
- Thank you.
BARRY:
- But we're not done yet.
 :
Listen, everyone!
 :
This runway is covered
with the last pollen
 :
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.
 :
That means this is our last chance.
 :
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.
 :
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

 :
Are we going to be bees, or just
Museum of Natural History keychains?
BEES:
We're bees!
BEE WHO LIKES KEYCHAINS:
Keychain!
BARRY:
Then follow me! Except Keychain.
POLLEN JOCK #1:
Hold on, Barry. Here.
 :
You've earned this.
BARRY:
Yeah!
 :
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
(The Pollen Jocks throw Barry a nectar-collecting gun. Barry catches it)
Oh, yeah.
JANET:
That's our Barry.
(Barry and the Pollen Jocks get pollen from the flowers on the plane)
(Flash forward in time and the Pollen Jocks are flying over NYC)
 :
(Barry pollinates the flowers in Vanessa's shop and then heads to Central
Park)
BOY IN PARK:
Mom! The bees are back!
ADAM:
(Putting on his Krelman hat)
If anybody needs

to make a call, now's the time.
 :
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!
(The bee honey factories are back up and running)
(Meanwhile at Vanessa's shop)
VANESSA:
(To customer)
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Can I help who's next?
 :
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
(There is a room in the shop where Barry does legal work for other animals.
He is currently talking with a Cow)
COW:
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!
 :
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!
BARRY:
I had no idea.
VANESSA:
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?
BARRY:
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.
MOOSEBLOOD:
Sorry I'm late.
COW:
He's a lawyer too?

MOOSEBLOOD:
Ma'am, I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.
VANESSA:
Have a great afternoon!
 :
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.
BARRY:
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.
VANESSA:
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Can I help who's next?
BARRY:
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.
VANESSA:
Thank you, Barry!
(Ken walks by on the sidewalk and sees the "bee-approved honey" in
Vanessa's shop)
KEN:
That bee is living my life!!
ANDY:
Let it go, Kenny.
KEN:
- When will this nightmare end?!
ANDY:
- Let it all go.
BARRY:
- Beautiful day to fly.
POLLEN JOCK:

- Sure is.
BARRY:
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.
(Barry recreates the scene near the beginning of the movie where he flies
through the box kite. The movie fades to black and the credits being)
[--after credits; No scene can be seen but the characters can be heard
talking over the credits--]
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend!
 :
- Thinking bee!
- Me?
BARRY:
(Talking over singer)
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.
 :
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Can we stop here?
SINGER:
Oh, BarryBARRY:
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!
SINGER:
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.
BARRY:
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
